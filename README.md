# Cyber Security Base 2020 Course Project
This Cyber Security 2020 course project presents a Django web application for users to keep notes. The application is not only incredibly horrible to use but is also severly flawed. The security flaws belong to the [OWASP top ten list](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
